## Summary  
My first game made in Unity 3D (that is not a game jam!). Itâ€™s a First Person Shooter with 3 levels. Your objective is to kill all the enemies and survive the chaos!

## Features  
- You can use weapons that shoot by instance or hitscan  
- There are 3 types of enemies (A clown that can shoot you, a rabbit, and a guy that explodes when you get near... He also dances.)
- 3 challenging levels:  
  - **Level 1**: You choose a weapon and kill an enemy.  
  - **Level 2**: You kill all the enemies that there are.  
  - **Level 3**: You get to the end of the level by surviving an enemy ambush!
